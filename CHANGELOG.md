# Changelog / release notes

WebGPU and wgpu-native are still changing fast, and with that we do to. We do
not yet attempt to make things backwards compatible. Instead we try to
be precise about tracking changes to the public API.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Possible sections in each release:

* Added: for new features.
* Changed: for changes in existing functionality.
* Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.
* Removed: for now removed features.
* Fixed: for any bug fixes.
* Security: in case of vulnerabilities.
